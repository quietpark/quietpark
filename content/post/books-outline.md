刚看完的一本书。一位从伦敦去雅典教短期写作课的作家，在希腊变成一位倾听者在人群中穿梭。读这本书的时候，脑海里总是不自觉地浮现出画面。整篇的对话中，不自觉就代入了作者的观察者角色，像是自己在跟这些虚构的人物对话。或者是跟作者的对话，也许只是与自己对话。

"And for me, of course, it would be disastrous to have more children: I would be completely submerged, as so many women are. I ask myself why it is my mother wishes to see me submerged in my turn, when I have important work to do, when it would not be in my best interests and would be, as I say, tantamount to disaster, and the answer is that her desire is not about me but about herself. I'm sure she wouldn't wish me to consider myself a failure for not being the mother of six children, yet that is precisely what her behaviour could cause me to feel." - Angeliki
