Mixed by wind  
flavoured by air  
the taste of Friday night cocktail  
  
Pond, artefacts, hookah  
we sit by the table  
voices, coming from different directions  
and your eyes are telling  
  
Few sips down  
things start to flow  
there is no end to our moan  
  
There is no moon  
we eat, laugh, and put back on our optimism  
before the underground closes
