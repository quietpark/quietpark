Mixed marriage

There's no place like home  
but home's not where I am  
home is where I'm safe and sound  
home is where my family's grand.

There's no place like home  
and I've lived in a house.  
I got married across the fence  
and I've been called a tout.

And my protestant friend beside me  
saved me from a petrol bomb  
me with a wee one, six weeks old  
my neighbour's love kept me from harm.

There's no place like love  
and my love's mixed and matched.  
Him from a Protestant and British stock  
and me from the Irish and Catholic stash.
