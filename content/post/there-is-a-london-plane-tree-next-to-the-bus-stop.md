More work to do at night  
to blow off the pollen  
from London plane trees  
people complain about it every time  
  
This is our kingdom  
declared by the king unswervingly  
sending an army of ants out  
patrolling on the trunk tirelessly  
  
Sparrows, in a sudden loss of branches  
complain the shrink of their playground  
where do we gather now to continue our morning chords  
while crows and magpies watching from the wires
