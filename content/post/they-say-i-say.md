They say you don't care  
I say I saw stars in your eyes  
on the night before leaving Tokyo  
when we greeted the last time  
  
They say you are cruel  
I say you cut cat's fingernails  
such a mellow video  
with tenderness and gentle  
  
I say I miss those conversations  
of trees, cows, urinals and memories  
And I wonder how's your cactus  
  
I say feelings hit me strong in recent days  
when photos taken, ideas arisen, and sentences written  
yet the green light on the app remains unlighted  
  
They say not to overthink  
I say time will tell  
They say move on as it goes  
I say you have my blessings  
They say don't change yourself for this  
I say love me then take it all  
  
What else can I say  
Probably things start to reveal  
when there is no more to be said.
